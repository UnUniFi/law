# Discord

## Rules

- Don't use DMs. There are some reasons:
  - DMs are sometimes used by scammers.
  - Asking some questions with DMs forces `@core` or `@moderator` a burden.
- Multilingual channels are not for national channels or ethnic channels. They are just for linguistic channels.
- Discord is not a place to appeal national prestige. So please refrain from reacting with national flag emoji.
