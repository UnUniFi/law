# Discord

## Rules

- Don't use DMs because some scammers use DMs.
  - If a person who proclaim himself to be a member of team uses DMs to you, regard him as a scammer.
- Multilingual channels are not for national channels or ethnic channels. They are just for linguistic channels.
- Discord is not a place to appeal national prestige. So please refrain from reacting with national flag emoji.
